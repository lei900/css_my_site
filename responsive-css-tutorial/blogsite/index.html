            To make sure iPhone users don't expect iMessage-only features when
            texting Android users, Apple marks the chat bubbles in blue ("you
            are texting someone with iMessage") and green ("you are texting
            someone without iMessage"). This segmentation has then evolved into
            discrimination against green bubbles, especially among young
            smartphone users in the U.S.

            “The sufferings of the town are increasing daily, and it is not
            doubted that a great tragedy is approaching,” read a report in the
            New York Times. “If Tabriz holds out, thousands must die of
            starvation, while if it falls probably tens of thousands will be
            massacred.”

            Furious with his father for making what he viewed to be his
            God-given authority suddenly contingent upon the will of the people,
            Muhammad Ali Shah launched an all-out assault on the
            constitutionalists. He tore up the constitution his father had
            signed, declared martial law, and rolled canons to the threshold of
            parliament, destroying the building with the parliamentarians still
            inside. With the help of his Russian trained Cossack Brigade, the
            young shah violently reclaimed every city in Persia for the crown —
            every city, that is, except Tabriz.

            Nevertheless, Baskerville had been repeatedly instructed by both the
            Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions and the State Department not
            to engage in any activity outside of his responsibilities as a
            missionary and teacher. So that is what he did.

            The American Christian Missionary Who Died Fighting For Freedom In
            Iran
          </h2>
          <p>
            I HAVE ALWAYS known the name Howard Baskerville. For as long as I
            can remember, his name was a flash in the corner of my eye. When I
            was a child growing up in Iran, there were schools named after him.
            His face, cast in bronze, was prominently displayed in a museum in
            Tabriz, the city in which he died and was buried. His tomb is still
            there, pressed up against an overgrown apricot tree, in a
            long-abandoned cemetery. The edges of the sarcophagus are smooth and
            worn — not from the elements, but from a century or so of curious
            hands. People used to come here from all over the country to honor
            the American who gave his life for Iran. These days, hardly anyone
            comes at all. Those few who still visit his tomb know little about
            the man lying inside, save for the bare facts of his life and death.

            He was twenty-two years old, a Christian missionary. He came to
            Persia (modern day Iran) in the fall of 1907 to teach English and
            history and to preach the Gospel. He took up arms and fought
            alongside his students in a bloody revolution against a ruthless
            tyrant. He died a martyr in the cause of freedom and democracy.
